<h1>Hi 👋, It's Jay</h1>


## 👨‍💼 About Me

I’m Jay, currently working as a **Quality & Data Manager** with over 5 years of experience in operations, client handling, and quality assurance in the B2B service sector.
After discovering my passion for data, I transitioned into **Data Analytics** through dedicated learning and real-world projects.
I’ve completed a Data Analytics certification and a **7-month internship** as a Data Analyst at Grras IT Training & Solutions Pvt. Ltd.  
Additionally, I’ve completed a **6-month internship** as a Data Analyst with Cognifyz Technologies, where I worked on practical tasks using SQL, Power BI, and Python.  I enjoy working with data to solve business problems, optimize processes, and support decision-making with clear insights and visualizations.  
I’m actively building real-world projects and transitioning into a full-time **Data Analyst role**.
